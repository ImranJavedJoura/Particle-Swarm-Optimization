# Particle-Swarm-Optimization
Particle swarm optimization in C++ on Ackley's Function.

there are three classes in this project
1) Swarm: manages all particles and stores global best solution. 
2) Particle: simulates a single particle. have attributes like maxSpeed, velocity, location, and nostalgia(local best solution).
3) Vector: used be Particle to store location, velocity etc.
