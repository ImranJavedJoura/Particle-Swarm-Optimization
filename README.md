# Particle-Swarm-Optimization
Particle swarm optimization in C++ on Ackley's Function.

there are four classes in this project
1) Swarm: manages all particles and stores global best solution. 
2) Particle: simulates a single particle. have attributes like maxSpeed, velocity, location, and nostalgia(local best solution).
3) Nostalgia: to store a solution instance and its objective function value.
4) Vector: used by Particle to store location, velocity etc.
